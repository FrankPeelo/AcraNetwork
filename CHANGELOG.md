# Changelog

## 1.1.0

This is a significant change to how the Chapter10 modules are organised. The previous organisation reflected the common
useage of the term Chapter10 to mean Chapter10 and Chapter11

This change moves all Chapter10 into IRIG106 namespace and then based on their location in the IRIG spec, namely Chapter10 or Chapter11

The existing structure will be supported but with a Deprecation warning
